    "The Therapeutic Touch (TT) is the idea that everyone can feel the Human Energy Field (HEF) around individuals. Certain practictioners claim they have the ability to feel the HEF and can massage it in order to promote health and relaxation in individuals. Those who practice TT have described different people's HEFs as \"warm as Jell-O\" and \"tactile as taffy\". \n",

    "\n",
    "Emily took 21 TT practitioners and used them for her science experiment. She would take a TT practitioner and ask them to extend their hands through a screen (which they can't see through). Emily would be on the other side and would flip a coin. Depending on how the coin landed, she would put out either her left hand or her right hand. The TT practitioner would then have to correctly answer which hand Emily put out. Overall, through 210 samples, the practitioner picked the correct hand 44% of the time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Emily's main goal here was to test whether or not the TT practicioners' guesses were random, like the flip of a coin. In most medical experiments, this is the norm. We want to test whether or not the treatment has an effect, *not* whether or not the treatment actually works. \n",
