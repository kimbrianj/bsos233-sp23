    "So far in this class, we've started out by doing some data management, then started using numerical and graphical summaries to describe data. In this midterm project, you will need to combine all of that together to write up a report using the Cards Against Humanity Pulse of the Nation dataset, provided in `201709-CAH_PulseOfTheNation.csv`, or the Gapminder datasets that we used in Lab 5. In this project, you will **formulate a question** that can be answered by this dataset, then use **descriptive statistics and graphs** to answer that question. The question that you may ask is quite open-ended, but I've provided scenarios below to help you get started.\n",

    "## Formatting Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "**Write a report** that includes:\n",
    "- A clear description of the **question of interest** and the variables you are studying.\n",
    "- A description of the **data management steps** including adjustment of the categories in categorical variables, formatting of  variables, subsetting, joins, and more. \n",
    "- **Descriptive statistics** that help the reader understand the data better. \n",
    "- **Visualizations** better illustrate the relationships that you are trying to show.\n",
    "- A clear **conclusion** based on your analysis, including a clear **plan of action.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your report in a Jupyter Notebook (you can use the Project Template provided), formatting it so that the code is included with the text. You can include a title and section headings by using '#' symbols in Markdown formatting. **DO NOT use commenting or print to provide the text of the report.** You can use comments to make code clearer, but the report itself should contain text in Markdown cells. **Any text that is not in Markdown cells (either printed or in comments) will not be considered as part of the report narrative.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, when formulating your research question, think about how it might be used. **You need to have a policy/action that you suggest at the end.** That is, any analysis is useless if you have no way of using it."
